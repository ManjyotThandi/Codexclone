# Project 3 - Codex

This project is a react application that competes with the likes of Stack Overflow and DIEM. The application in question is called Codex and it is an online based freelancing platforming that mimics the usability of Stack Overflow. Codex will enable users to post a question and set a bounty for the question to be solved by the community of developers on the platform.

### **The Wireframes**

This is the main page of the website where a developer can see and select a posted code to be build. Someone can navigate through this page by customizing their search by various parameters (languages shown as a sample parameter).

The profile page as shown below, consists of the user dashboard which has their user settings, user score, user info, user history (questions answered and questions posted), user trophies and etc. The user will also be able to access the payments through this page to get tokens and redeem tokens.

The payments page will allow you to make payments to buy tokens on the website, which will be used as a trading system and exchange between the questioner and answerer. The tokens can be bought using paypal and a variety of credit/debit cards. The information on this page will be used securely using encryption methods.
